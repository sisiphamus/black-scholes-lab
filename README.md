# BLACK-SCHOLES-LAB

There's a single equation behind roughly $600 trillion in outstanding derivatives contracts, and most people who use it daily treat it as a black box. Plug in volatility, get a price, move on.

This is not a calculator. It's a laboratory.

Drag volatility and watch how delta surfaces warp. Step through time decay and see theta eat away at an option's value. Explore how the Greeks interact -- how gamma spikes near expiration, how vega behaves differently for in-the-money vs. out-of-the-money strikes. The kind of intuition you can't get from a formula sheet.

Currently just the Next.js foundation. The math and visualizations are coming.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
