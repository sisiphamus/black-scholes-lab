# Black-Scholes Lab

An interactive options pricing laboratory built with Next.js.

This project will be a hands-on environment for exploring the Black-Scholes model and its extensions. Instead of plugging numbers into a calculator and getting a price back, the goal is to let you see how each input (volatility, time, strike, rate) warps the pricing surface in real time. Built for learning through experimentation.

## Planned

- Real-time options pricing with adjustable parameters (S, K, T, r, sigma)
- Interactive Greeks visualization (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
- 3D pricing surface that responds to parameter changes
- Implied volatility solver and volatility smile visualization
- Put-call parity demonstration
- Comparison between Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, and Monte Carlo pricing methods

## Tech

Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4

## Status

Scaffolded and ready for implementation. Part of a quantitative finance toolkit alongside [monte-carlo](https://github.com/sisiphamus/monte-carlo), [stat-arb](https://github.com/sisiphamus/stat-arb), [plasma](https://github.com/sisiphamus/plasma), and [neutron](https://github.com/sisiphamus/neutron).
